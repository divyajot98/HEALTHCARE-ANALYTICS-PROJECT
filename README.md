# HEALTHCARE-ANALYTICS-PROJECT

**Introduction**

Healthcare organizations are under increasing pressure to improve patient care outcomes and achieve better care. While this situation represents a challenge, it also offers organizations an opportunity to dramatically improve the quality of care by leveraging more value and insights from their data. Health care analytics refers to the analysis of data using quantitative and qualitative techniques to explore trends and patterns in the acquired data. While healthcare management uses various metrics for performance, a patient’s length of stay is an important one.

Being able to predict the length of stay (LOS) allows hospitals to optimize their treatment plans to reduce LOS, to reduce infection rates among patients, staff, and visitors.


**Project Goal**

The goal of this project is to accurately predict the Length of Stay for each patient so that the hospitals can optimize resources and function better.

**Hypothesis Generation**

Understanding the problem in detail by assuming different factors that impact the outcomes of Length of Stay before any data exploration or analysis. Here the variables can be divided into two levels: Patient-Level and Hospital-Level.

**Patient-Level:**

• Type of Admission – Patients can be admitted in three levels Urgent, Emergency, and Trauma. Patients admitted to urgent care are likely to stay fewer days. Whereas Trauma patients usually stay longer because they must be monitored until they are qualified to be discharged.
• Severity of Illness – Severity can be classified as Minor, Moderate, and Extreme. A patient recorded as minor will stay fewer days than a patient recorded as extreme.
• Visitors with Patient – Patients with more visitors are like to stay longer in the hospital.
• Age – Infants and older Patients usually take a longer time to recover so they stay longer than younger Patients.
• Admission Deposit – Patients who are likely to deposit a high amount of money at the time of admission might have severe conditions and stay longer.

**Hospital-Level:**

• Ward Type – Patients allocated in ICU might stay longer than the general ward as their condition is more severe.
• Department – Patients under surgery are likely to stay longer than gynecology as their recovery time is longer.
